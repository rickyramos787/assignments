# User input using input() function
## 1. User Input
a.
```python
#Convert kilograms into pounds
kg = float(input("Enter your kg value: "))
pounds = kg * 2.2
print("Weight in pounds: ", pounds)
```
b.


## 2. Troubleshooting
    a.  Valid: Variable names can contain letters.
    b.  Valid: Variable names can begin with an underscore.
    c.  Invalid: Variable names cannot begin with !. Python only allows letters, numbers, and underscores.
    d.  Valid: You are overwriting Python's built-in print() function.
    e.  Invalid: False is a reserved Boolean keyword in Python. It cannot be reassigned. 

## Challenges
  -  The most challenging part of this exercise was understanding how to properly
convert user input into the correct data type (float or int). I also had to
carefully apply the formulas for the average daily balance and distance formula.
Another challenge was remembering that some words like False are reserved
keywords and cannot be used as variable names.
